I am 29 years old, currently employed as a post-doctoral researcher at the
University of Manchester. Originally from
Scotland, I grew up in the town of Hawick in the Scottish Borders, with my
university education taking place at the University of Glasgow. 
Besides the UK, I have lived for several months in Washington DC and undertook a
long-term research attachment at CERN in Geneva, where I continue to work
through my employment with the University of Manchester.

I am interested in understanding the world, through data, through scientific
discovery, through simulation. My interests are extremely broad. I have analysed
the behaviour of flapping wings and designed hypersonic vehicles as part of my
aerospace undergraduate degree. I have studied the structure of the Standard
Model and of new theories of particle physics. I research the behaviour of the
heaviest fundamental particle and its interactions, and published the first
measurement of quantum entanglement at the Large Hadron Collider.

My other interests include reading fiction, playing the piano, differential
geometry, sweating it out on the tennis court, hiking through the Swiss Alps,
skiing through the French Alps, cooking, and trying to find a good place in Geneva for a
beer.
