<!-- # Physics  -->

I work with the ATLAS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN,
Geneva, on several different areas of high-energy particle physics.

## Properties of the Top Quark
The top quark is the heaviest fundamental particle. This fact alone means that
the top quark is extremely interesting to study. It provides us with a test for
the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and allows us to investigate
avenues of New Physics (i.e. physics not in the Standard Model.)

I am interested in properties of the top quark, particularly how it spins. We
have studied top quark spin correlations and polarisations using the ATLAS Run-2
dataset in several top production mechanisms.

Our paper [Observing ttZ spin correlations at the
LHC](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-09605-8)
describes the phenomenology and proposed measurements of top-quark spin
properties in ttZ production at the LHC. 


## Quantum Information in Collider Physics
I am interested in the intersection between collider physics and quantum
information. We are looking to make measure quantum phenomena such as
entanglement in top quark and W boson qubit and qutrit states, the first of such
measurements ever undertaken in a high-energy physics context!

## Setting Limits on New Physics 
The effective field theory (EFT) framework is an extremely popular means of
constraining where new physics may be. I am interested in applying the EFT method
to the top-quark sector: constructing new observables to probe the SMEFT in new
directions (including ML-derived obseravbles), and using LHC top-quark data to
set new limits on beyond-Standard Model physics. 

This plot shows expected limits - but I need to change this plot don't I...

## Machine Learning for Fast Simulation
Simulation of the interaction between particles and the ATLAS detector is
incredibly CPU-intensive. This work looks at applying DNN and GNN regression
techniques to write emulate the detector response in an expeditious way.
