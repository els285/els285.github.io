Here is the page for my interests


## Machine Learning
I am extremely interested in machine learning: theoretical developments,
in the context of new technologies, but particularly in scientific applications.
In any career progression, I am hopeful to work developing machine learning
models to solve interesting problems. Of particular interest is geometric
machine learning in its many guises: I am curious about the application of
normalising flows in high-energy physics contexts, and have developed the
HEPGraphs package for interfacing high-energy physics data to the
`Pytorch-Geometric` framework.


## Python Development

In my spare time, I like to develop Python packages, to help develop my advanced
Python skills and to apply data science diagnostics and visualisation to
data-problems applicable to my everyday life.

In a finance context, I have developed [`starlingpy`](https://github.com/els285/StarlingPy) and [`costsplit`](https://github.com/els285/CostSplit).
I use `starlingpy` to track my finances, categorise transactions and visualise
expenditure in an interactive web-app. `costsplit` is a shameless rip-off
(though all original code) of those apps designed to simplify repayments between
members of large groups.

In a HEP context, I use my [`heptools`](https://github.com/els285/HEPTools) package day-to-day to explore ROOT data
and visualise histograms. The [`hepdash`](https://github.com/els285/HEPDash) package is a web-based interactive tools
for histogram visualisation, built around the `streamlit` package. 

## Aerospace

Harking back to my undergraduate days, I have developed [`AeroJulia`](https://github.com/els285/AeroJulia), a
Julia-lang package which contains many aerodynamic and thermodynamic tools for
solving problems in compressible fluid mechanics (sometimes called gas dynamics)
contexts.
