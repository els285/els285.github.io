Hi, I'm Ethan, a PhD student with the ATLAS Collaboration at CERN, Geneva. With
my PhD finishing in the Spring of 2023, I am actively seeking career
opportunities.

This website is built with the intention of introducing myself, my interests and
my work. The [Physics](https://els285.github.io/physics/) page highlights areas of research within my high-energy
physics PhD; the [Interests](https://els285.github.io/interests/) page showcases physics research, data science and
software projects external to the PhD. If you are interested in reaching out,
please get in contact using the details on the [Contact](https://els285.github.io/contact/) page.
